                    <p>
                        (Michigan)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So our apartment complex uses dog dna tracing program for left behind dog poop piles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They charge $375 per left behind pile. When we moved in we had to agree to swab the dog for the
                        program
                        via the lease requirement however the people who worked in the office didn’t know how to do it/
                        file it.
                        After a few tries with the same answer we had forgotten about it since a month or so went by.
                        Fast
                        forward a year and we resign a new lease and they didn’t mention the program and we had long
                        forgotten
                        about it. Fast forward a month or so ago I was walking my dog before work and obviously picking
                        up her
                        poop to put it in the bin when our complex manager slowly followed me in her car. I thought it
                        was weird
                        but then she all of the sudden calls and demands that our dog get swabbed for the program so we
                        said ok
                        and did that. We have always picked up every single poop that she lays since she was even a
                        puppy. Today
                        we get a letter saying that they have the dna on file and matched it to upwards of 10 poop piles
                        dating
                        back almost 2 years! They are trying to charge 6 GRAND for this nonsense and it’s completely
                        false! I am
                        beyond stressed out and don’t even know where to begin with something like this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any advice is appreciated!
                    </p>
